**NIKSLearn - Online Learning Platform (PWA)**

NIKSLearn is a modern, responsive online learning platform built with pure HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project features a clean and accessible user interface where visitors can browse a variety of educational courses.

The main content includes a hero section with a call-to-action and a dedicated "Popular Courses" section. Here, courses like **Web Development**, **Data Science**, and **UX/UI Design** are presented on individual cards with playful, non-commercial pricing labels (e.g., "Priceless," "Expensive").

The platform is enhanced with interactive elements such as a mobile-friendly navigation menu and a sliding sidebar for quick links and course categories, improving the overall user experience. It is designed as a static, front-end project, emphasizing that no user data is stored on a server.
